## My personal homework stash

Feel free to look for solutions here if you feel puzzled (don't copy them tho, at least make it not obvious).
If you are my teacher, pretend you didn't see that.

## FAQ

### How to copy everything?

You can explore the code directly on github, but if you wish to run/modify it this section is for you. Helpful for both teacher and students:)

#### Solution 1

If you don't have git and you don't want to install it, download zip [here](https://github.com/NinVoido/PythonHW/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

#### Solution 2

Type this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/NinVoido/PythonHW
cd PythonHW
```

### How to access newer homeworks in my local folder?

If you cloned this repo via git, just type `git pull origin main` and they should appear. If you downloaded it with the link provided above, redownload it.

### Your code doesn't work!

#### Solution 1

If you use Windows, it might be because of broken file paths - just replace all "/" with "\\".

#### Solution 2

Message me and I'll try to do something about it:)
